My Windows Terminal settings.

## Use

* `git clone` repo
* Locate current `settings.json` in `[user-dir]\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal[...]\LocalState`
* Rename current `settings.json` to `settings.json.bak`
* Copy cloned settings to `settings.json` in said dir.
* Copy cloned background image to location in `[user-dir]\Pictures\`
* (Possibly fix-up hardwired path to user-dir in `settings.json`-file)
